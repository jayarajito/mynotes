ConfigMaps and Secrets are special type of volumes

Do Not hardcode the properties which is going to change for each environment

3 Ways to Configure Data:

Passing Arguments
Configuration Files
Environment Variables

configuration data should be place in common place and refer the path in the yaml definition

ConfigMap:
---------
kubectl api-resources | grep ConfigMap

in config map instead of spec
we have data field, this data field accept key vlue pair

Not only string values we also define configuration file in the configmap
Example
mongodb.conf: |
  storage:
    dbPath: /data/configdb
  replication:
       replSetName:"rs0"

ConfigMaps data limit is 1 Mb

if you want do not change configmap values then use immutable:true
the default value is false
so this can not be edited only can deleted or recreate

kubectl apply -f cmname.yaml
kubectl get cm

we can use the configmap data in the yaml file as env: under containers
instead of value use valueFrom:
configMapKeyRef:
 key:username
 name:mongodb-config

how to use configuration file defined in the configMap in statefulset.yaml

There are several steps included

Config map and the pods are should be in the same namespace

configmap consumed as env are not updated automatically , this needs pod restart


Secrets
-------
If you want to store sensitive information then go with secrets

The only differne secrets are secure

The data in the secret must be given as base 64 encoded data

encode in cmd

echo -n text | base64

decode in cmd
echo -n encodedvalue | base64 --decode

Kind: Secret

SecretKeyRef:

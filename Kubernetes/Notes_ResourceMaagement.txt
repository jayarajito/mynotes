What we will learn:
Requesting CPU and Memory
Limiting CPU and Memory
Quality fo Service
Setting min,max and default resources for pods in a namespace - LimitRange
Limiting resources in a namespaces-ResourceQuota

Computing Resurces:
CPU and Memory

1cpu (1000m)
200m is 0.2 cpu m-milicore


Every container we can define the   requests(minimum resource) under resources in yaml file

Also we can define limits, maximume resouce can allocate

If requested resource is not available then the pod container is pending state in status, but pod is created

best practices is define the request and limits

if pod will use more than the speicfied memory,then it will killed -that is called OOMKilled

if pod will use more than the specified cpu, then The container's performance will slow down as its CPU access is restricted- that is called CPU throttling 

requst and limits are defined by container level, not by the pod level

get the node information

kubectl get nodes

kubectl describe node <node-name>


kubectl top node <node-name>


Once the Pod is created it does not allow to change the resources

kubectl get pods -o wide

you can check how much the resources the pods are using

kuectl top pods


we need a metrics server, so need to enable it, by default enabled in eks, aks


if you wnat to limit the resoure for the Pods then use the Kind: LimitRange
under limits: you can define min and max


if you wnat to limit the resource for the namespaces then use the kind:ResourceQuota
under hard: you can define

not only requst and limits you can define number of pods, secrects,configmaps,servies,persistentvolumeclaims

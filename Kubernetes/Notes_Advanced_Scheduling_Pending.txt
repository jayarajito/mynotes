Advanced Scheduling in k8s

Scheduler is responsible for schduing the pods and nodes

Customize the Scheduler using
nodeName
nodeSelector
Affinity
Taints and Tolerations

We can instruct to the scheduler to shedule the pods in perticular nodes

nodeName:
---------

In the deployment yaml file you can define the nodeName: under template spec:
you can define in Pod level

nodeSelector:
-------------
In the node name all the pods will created on the same node. so this is not good practie for the high availability.


you can add a labels for Nodes, label should be in key value pair

kubectl label node nodename team=analytics

Add the same label for another node

kubectl label node nodename2 team=analytics

Verify node labels

kubectl get nodes --show-labels

kubectl get nodes -l team=analytics

use the this in yaml file
nodeSelector:
  team:analytics


apply the yaml file

now the pods will created in 2 nodes

Affinity:
---------
This will schedule with advanced complex conditons with operator

This is 2 types
Node Affinity and Pod Affinity

Node Affinity:
This also 2 types
soft:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

Hard:
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

confusing so stoped, more compliated

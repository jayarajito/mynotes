Introduction to YAML:
---------------------

human readable and easy to understand

“YAML” is an acronym which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" or "Yet Another Markup Language." 

Serialization Language:
----------------------
YAML -YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language):
JSON -JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
XML - XML (Extensible Markup Language):

Serialization:
The process of converting a data object or structure into a sequence of bytes or characters. 

Deserialization:
The reverse process of reconstructing a data object or structure from its serialized form. 


Configuration fils are written in yaml rather than json

Json uses curly brackets {}
XmL uses angle brackets <>
yaml - no any such special character, instead it use line separation and indentation


Write yaml file:
---------------
Most of things in key value pair
name: local-cluster
space after colon is mandatory

you can use any case like camel case,snake case(using underscores and all letters are in lowercase)


yaml automatically deduct the data type based on the values.

For string wheter you can use '' "" or nothing

if you wnat to explicitly menction datatype then use like
!!str 1245

use # for comments inline
yaml does not support multiline comments

for array(list) is - (hypen)

you can group by dictionary(map)
access:
  ip: 192.168.1.1
  port: 8444

YAML Data Types
YAML supports a variety of basic data types - strings, integers, floating point, and booleans.


Boolean values can be defined via three keywords in YAML - True / False, Yes / No, and On / Off. 

YAML Data Types - Folding Strings

It’s possible to write long strings in YAML by using the “>” operator. 

myJoke: >	
  How did the programmer die in the shower? 
  A. He read the shampoo bottle instructions: 
  Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

These strings will be concatenated into a single string when read from the file. 

YAML Data Types - Block Strings
It’s possible to write multi-line strings in YAML by using the “|” operator.

myBetterJoke: |
  Give a man a program, and frustrate him for a day. 
  Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.

triple dash says new documents start, you can write multiple documetns in the same yaml file

---


you can use variable as &clusterVersion !!str 1.22.1

you can use the variable name *clusterVersion in multiple places

to declare a variable use the symbol &
to access a variable use the symbol *

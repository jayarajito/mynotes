Anisble is Agentless
Control Node - Ansible Installed
Manage Nodes = Other Machines (Python required)
Ansible Takes the yaml file and convert to Python code

Passwordless Authentication

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_cofig.d uncomment the PasswordAuthenticaton yes 

sudo ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile test.pem" ubuntu@54.153.78.49

How control node understand the manage nodes

Inventory is a file here we can put the nodes name
This file location can be anywhere
This file is hart of the Ansible

we can create 2 ways
inventory.ini
inventory.yaml

inside a file put the instance login

user@ip

adhoc commands

ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all
ansible -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "apt install openjdk" all
ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping ubuntu@ip

You can group the server as per needed like app server, db server

[app]
servers

[db]
servers

ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping db

Anible Playbook
Start with 3 dash ---

Running Ansible Playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini filename.yaml


state absent means uninstall
state present means install


Ansible Roles
split the different section into folder inside folder you can write individual yaml
ansible-galaxy role init nameoftherole
this will create a role and inside role few foldes and file created like 8
README.md
files  
templates -used to put the dynamically changing file
vars
tasks
tests
meta
defaults - used for variables, but here default values present
handlers - used for tasks but only executed upon a perticular actions, in the main task you want to notify

you can upload this role to Ansible Galaxy like docuker registry
you can share across organazation and outside of the organazation


How to install roles

ansible-galaxy role install bsmeding.docker

import roles
ansible-galaxy import githubusername repositoryname --token 445454

Now this will imported in you Galexy Under roles in Role Namespaces



We can create cloud resouces using Ansible Collections


apart from the built in module others are collections

collection has combination of modules and roles

ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
in control node needs to be installed boto3 python module

to secure the api key the ansible has built in vault

ansible-vault create group_vars/all/pass.yml --vault-password-file vault.pass

ansible-playbook -i invontary.ini create_ec2.yaml --vault-password-file vault.pass


we can declare variables in multiple places almost around 22

you can access variable using {{ type }}

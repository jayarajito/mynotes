Self-Introduction for HR Induction
Good [Morning/Afternoon], everyone.

My name is Jayaraj Narayanan, and I’m joining as a DevOps/System Engineer. I bring 4.2 years of experience in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Systems Administration.

In my previous role at Anthology International, I worked extensively on automating infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible across AWS and Azure environments. I implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, containerized applications with Docker, and managed Kubernetes clusters. I also used monitoring tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and CloudWatch to ensure system reliability.

I hold a Master’s in Computer Applications and am certified in Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) and Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900). I’ve also completed a DevOps Master’s Program, enhancing my skills in tools such as Jenkins, Git, SonarQube, Argo CD, and scripting with Python and Bash.

I’m enthusiastic about contributing to scalable and secure infrastructure solutions and am excited to collaborate with the team. I look forward to learning and growing with you all.

Thank you!

The contents of a Dockerfile describe how to create and build a Docker image, 
while docker-compose is a command that runs Docker containers based on settings described in a docker-compose.yaml file.





docker network create -d bridge my-net
docker run --network=my-net -itd --name=container3 busybox



bridge	The default network driver.

By default, bridge networks are private to the host, meaning external systems can't directly access the containers unless you expose ports using -p or -P.

host	Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.

none	Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.

overlay	Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.

ipvlan	IPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

macvlan	Assign a MAC address to a container.




In Docker, bind mounts and volumes are both used to share files between the host machine and a container, but they differ in how they handle the data persistence and management. Bind mounts directly link a host directory to a container directory, while volumes create a directory within Docker's storage directory, allowing for easier management and portability even if the container is removed or stopped.

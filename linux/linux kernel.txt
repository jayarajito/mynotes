To check the kernel version in Linux, you can use the uname -r command, the cat /proc/version file, or the hostnamectl command. You can also use the dmesg command


    Print certain system information.  With no OPTION, same as -s.

       -a, --all
              print all information, in the following order, except omit -p and -i if unknown:

       -s, --kernel-name
              print the kernel name

       -n, --nodename
              print the network node hostname

       -r, --kernel-release
              print the kernel release

       -v, --kernel-version
              print the kernel version

       -m, --machine
              print the machine hardware name

       -p, --processor
              print the processor type (non-portable)

       -i, --hardware-platform
              print the hardware platform (non-portable)

       -o, --operating-system
              print the operating system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

uname -r

cat /proc/version

hostnamectl


sudo dmesg

uname -a
uname -m    it shows archit

lscpu Command – Show CPU Architecture Information. ...
cat /proc/cpuinfo – Show CPU Processor Info. ...
nproc Command – Show Processing Units or CPU Cores. ...


top -i
Copy
The system hides all the idle processes, making it easier to sort through the list.

after top command if you press the 1 it shows the all available cpu usage

htop

ps -ef | grep jenkins

ps aux


ps -eo pid,user,state,cmd --sort=-%cpu | grep " R "

Monitorring system resurces

ps aux --sort=-pcpu | head -11 
ps aux --sort=-pmem | head -11 

To check Total memory usage

free

free -m  you can see in mb g for gb


you can check the system uptime using


uptime

htop   

this will give you more option if you type u it will show the user group then you can see the that user usage

60 linux command in 15 miniutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w



The Linux tail command is a command-line utility that prints data from the end of a specified file or files to standard output. The utility provides an easy way to quickly see file updates in real time, as new data is usually added to the end of a file.

tail [options] [file]

By default, tail displays the last 10 lines of each [file] to standard output,

tail filename

Print Specific Number of Lines

tail -n 5 filename

head command, which displays the beginning of a file.

head filename

To print the entire file contents, use the cat command.

cat filename



To check system logs in Linux,


Enter cd /var/log to view system logs 

Type ls to see the logs in the directory 

Use commands like less, grep, or vi to search the logs 

Use the tail command to view the latest changes from a file in real time 


Use the journalctl command to view logs managed by systemd 


Use the strace command to trace system calls and signals 


less command

less is a command that displays file contents or command output one page at a time in your terminal. 

less your-file-name

ps -ef | less


To see line numbers on each line, use the -N option:


less -N your-file-name


spacebar	Move down one page.
b		Move up one page.
g		Go to the first line.
G		Go to the last line.
q		Quit less


Logs file

Some important log files include: 
/var/log/syslog: Tracks errors related to application services and messages logged when the system boots up 
/var/log/dmesg: Contains messages from the kernel ring buffer, which include information about hardware components, drivers, and kernel initialization 
/var/log/httpd: Contains error_log and access_log files of the Apache httpd daemon 
/var/log/kern.log: Stores kernel events, errors, and warning logs 


strace - Trace System calls and Signals
strace is a diagnostic tool in Linux. It intercepts and records any syscalls made by a command. 
Additionally, it also records any Linux signal sent to the process. We can then use this information to debug or diagnose a program. 

Using Strace to Trace Linux Syscalls

strace pwd

Attaching strace to Running Process

strace -p PID
strace -p 50



How to change shell timeout

Open the configuration file:
For individual user: Use a text editor to open your .bashrc file located in your home directory (~/.bashrc).
For all users: Edit the /etc/profile file with root privileges.



2. Add the TMOUT line:

# Inside your .bashrc file

export TMOUT=1800  

# This sets a 30-minute timeout (1800 seconds) 

If you give 1800 seconds in profile but only 18 seconds in ~/.bashrc, this will take place



tee Command and Piping

The tee command reads standard input (stdin) and writes it to both standard output (stdout) and one or more files.

Use the tee command to view your output immediately and at the same time, store it for future use.

ifconfig | tee example.txt

Warning: If the file used in the command already exists, tee overwrites the previous contents of the file.


Use Append to File

[command] | tee -a [filename]

echo "jayaraj" | tee jay.txt

echo "jayaraj1" | tee -a jay.txt


Links

There are two types of links :

Soft Link or Symbolic links
Hard Links

Basically hard link increases reference count of a location while soft links work as a shortcut (like in Windows) 

For example, if we have a file a.txt. If we create a hard link to the file and then delete the file, we can still access the file using hard link. But if we create a soft link of the file and then delete the file, we can’t access the file through soft link and soft link becomes dangling. 


The size of the soft link is equal to the length of the path of the original file we gave. 

Reference Type: Soft links are references to the pathname of a file or directory, while hard links are references to the inode of a file.

Behavior on Original File Deletion: When the original file is deleted, a soft link pointing to it becomes invalid (dangling), whereas a hard link remains valid as it points directly to the inode of the file.


Cross-Filesystem Linking: Soft links can point to files or directories across different filesystems because they refer to pathnames. Hard links can only be made to files (not directories) within the same filesystem, as they link directly to inodes.

Visibility: When listing directory contents with ls -l, soft links show the path to which they point using an arrow notation (->), whereas hard links appear as regular files, showing no indication that they are links.


Softlink Create

ln  -s [original filename] [link name]

touch mysoftorg

ln -s mysoftorg mysoftorglink  


Hardlink Crete
Creating a hard link in Linux does not require any special options with the ln command. The syntax is:

ln target_file link_name

touch myordorg

ln myordorg myordorglink



Remove link same as removing files
rm -rf filename

INodes

In Linux, an inode, or index node, is a data structure that stores information about files and directories. Inodes are unique identifiers for each file or directory in a filesystem. 

What does an inode store?
File type: Whether the file is a regular file, directory, or device 
File size: The size of the file in bytes 
File permissions: The access mode for the file, such as read, write, or execute 
File ownership: The owner of the file, including the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) 
File location: The disk block locations of the file's data 



ls -i
df -i


df -i /dev/sda1
ls -i Creating_volume_groups
ls -idl my_articles/

df -T  it shows file system type

while attahce the volume that volume should be dame availabiliyt zone
Weile attahing we need to give device name

lsblk  it shows disk and partigion

creaate a partiion
sudo fdisk /dev/xvdp

next command is

p - print the partition table you can use m for help to see all command

then

n - new partition

select next p for primary
then give partion number 1-4 

default sector selecction

next p

the w  for save it

Now this will show in lsblk

without formating we can not mount

example create a direcroty and mount it and it wont allow

suod mkdir data
sudo mount /dev/xvdp data

format means creating the filesytem

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdp1

now mount

sudo mount /dev/xvdp1 data

now this will show on df command

df -h


Now need to persistant, after reboot also

sudo vi /etc/fstab


we need uid
blkid /dev/xvdp1
/dev/xvdp1: UUID="d1a85484-a239-488f-b94d-8497850ce548" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="xfs" PARTUUID="706cb75a-01"


sudo file -s /dev/xvdp

sudo lsblk -f


sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig


sudo vim /etc/fstab


UUID=d1a85484-a239-488f-b94d-8497850ce548  /data  xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo umount /home/ubuntu/data

sudo mount -a

sudo mount /dev/xvdp1 /data
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

AS per AWS
lsblk

sudo file -s /dev/xvdp1


sudo lsblk -f

sudo umount /home/ubuntu/data

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdp

sudo mkdir /mydata

sudo mount /dev/xvdp /mydata

no time still proble deleteing

Ubuntu Upgrade Release
There are 2 types of Ubuntu releases: Interim and LTS. Each Ubuntu LTS is maintained for 10 years total: 5 years of standard support + 5 years of ESM. Interim releases are maintained for 9 months. Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)

Ubuntu supports the ability to upgrade from one LTS to the next in sequential order. For example, a user on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS can upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but cannot jump directly to Ubuntu 20.04


latest one
                                Released End of Standard Support	End of Ubuntu Pro Support	End of Legacy Suppor
24.10 (Oracular Oriole)
24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)	Apr 2024	Apr 2029	Apr 2034	Apr 2036


To upgrade, run the following commands:


sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


Upgrade the system

sudo do-release-upgrade



reload the user profile using source command

. is a bash builtin and a synonym for source          antonym

. ~/.profile
source ~/.bashrc



To check if Apache is running in Linux, you can use the 
systemctl status apache2      command on Debian/Ubuntu systems or 
systemctl status httpd        command on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems.

ps aux | grep httpd or 

ps aux | grep apache

Check a specific port number open or not

AWS 3 Tier Arcitecture Model

Any application has 
Front End
Backend
Database

then it is called 3 tire application

Some application database is not required so 2 tire application

watch day 24 EKS 2048 2 tire application


1. First create a VPC
secure one application project to anotehr projects

2. Split 3 subnets for 3 apps

for fronend use the Auto Scalling Group for deploying application to multiple ec2 instance, also 2 diffrent availabiliyt zones 

for backend also same


3. for database you can use RDS services
use primary RDS and secondary RDS


when users requst this goes to route53 and this goes to CDN and here goes to the ELB(public subnet)

from elb the requst goes to any one of the ec2 instances

This ec2 instance cordinated with ALB 

From the ALB the requst will goes to one of the backend ec2 instances

from the backend ec2 instance the requst goes to the primary RDS

for demo

create 2 vpc for 2 diffrent regoins for diaster recovery


we should not tell like this 3 tire app arcitecture when uisng the k8s 

if you using the ec2 instances then we can tell

If Jd describe container then tll k8s architecture

IF Jd describe application on ec2 instance then tell this architecture
